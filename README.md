# This is my study guide for our quiz tomorrow

An Indirect Command is a command which is reported, not directly stated. It is used by combining either ut or ne with a subjunctive.
This can be a present or imperfect subjunctive.
Note that this is very similar to purpose clauses.

In English, these use the infitnite. Example : My mom asked me to eat.

Three common commands take the dative for the person being commanded. These are:
impero, imperare, imperavi, imperatus, order/command
mando, mandare, mandavi, mandum, estrust/command/instruct
praecipio, praecipere, praecipi, praeceptum, instruct.

Example : Mihi imperavit ut discederem - He ordered me to leave. Mihi is dative, ut appears after imperavit, and discederem is an imperfect subjunctive.

Asking verbs:
peto, petere, petivi, petitum, seek
quaero, quaerere, quaesivi, quaesitum, ask
rogo, rogare, rogavi, rogatum, ask for

Peto and Quaero take an Ablative of Place from Where as the person being asked.
Rogo takes an accusative.

A me petit ne discedam - He asks me not to leave.
Me rogat ne discedam - He asks me not to leave. Note that this doesn't need the A because it isn't ablative.

Advising verbs:
adduco, adducere, adduxi, adductum, influence
moneo, monere, monui, monitum, warn/advise
persuadeo, persuadere, persuasi, persuasum

Adduco and Moneo take an accusativ, pursuadeo takes a dative.
Example: 
Me adducet ut discedam - He will influence me to leave
Mihi pursuadebit ut discedam - He will pursuade me to leave. Note the dative mihi.

Iubeo - bid/order. X orders Y to verb.
Instead of an indirect command, it always appears with an inifinitive. The person being ordered will ALWAYS be accusative.

Example: Dux Milites oppugnare iussit - The general ordered the soldiers to fight. Note that neither ut nor ne is used.

Important to note: Many negatives are changed, to go with the subjunctive.
Normal Negative ---- Translation ---- Negative Subjunctive
nec, neque           nor/and not      neve
nemo                 no one           ne quis (ne aliquis)
nihil                nothing          ne quid (ne aliquid)
non                  not              ne
nullus               no               ne ullus
numquam              never            ne umquam
